The `prime.md` file outlines a workflow for understanding a codebase, specifically focusing on the "fork terminal" skill. It directs the reader to examine `readme.md` for project overview, `skills/fork_terminal/skills.md` for skill purpose, `skills/fork_terminal/tools/fork_terminal.py` for implementation details, and other related markdown files for further context and examples. The primary goal is to facilitate comprehensive codebase analysis.
