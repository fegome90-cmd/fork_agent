# Summary of fork_summary_user_prompts.md

This document outlines a prompt structure for tracking user-agent conversations, specifically within the context of a "fork terminal" skill. It includes two main sections:

1.  **History**: This section records past interactions between the user and the agent, providing summaries of both `user_prompt_summary` (what the user asked) and `agent_response_summary` (how the agent responded). An example demonstrates a user requesting to fork a terminal using `gemini-cli` with a "fast model" to analyze a history file, and the agent confirming its preparation to fork the terminal.

2.  **Next User Request**: This section captures the most recent user instruction. In the provided example, the user asks the agent to analyze the current `.md` file and create a summary of it in the `.claude/docs` directory.
