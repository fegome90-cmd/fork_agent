# Fix Report: Add Prerequisites to README

## What was changed
- Added a new section `## Prerequisitos` in `README.md` immediately before the `## Instalación` section.
- Listed Python 3.8+ requirement.
- Included links for Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and Codex CLI.
- Added Linux-specific requirements for `tmux` and `zellij`.

## Why it was changed
- To improve the user onboarding experience by clarifying external dependencies before the installation steps.
- To ensure users have the necessary CLI tools installed to use specific agents (Gemini, Claude, Codex).
- To provide clear guidance for Linux users on terminal multiplexers.

## How to verify the fix
1. Open `README.md`.
2. Locate the `## Prerequisitos` section (it should be around line 45, before `## Instalación`).
3. Verify that all links are correct and the formatting is consistent with the rest of the document.
4. Confirm that the Python version and Linux tools are correctly listed.
