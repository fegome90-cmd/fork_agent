# Agent 3B - Project Vision Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of `idea.md` focusing on vision alignment, roadmap, and future plans for the fork_agent project.

## Ratings (1-10)
- Vision Clarity: 4/10
- Alignment with Implementation: 9/10
- Future Planning (Roadmap): 2/10
- Strategic Depth: 3/10

## Key Findings
1. **Structural Focus**: `idea.md` currently serves more as a directory manifest than a vision document, reflecting the project's structure precisely but lacking narrative.
2. **Implementation Alignment**: The file shows perfect alignment with the current codebase architecture (.claude/skills/fork_terminal hierarchy).
3. **Missing Roadmap**: There is no explicit roadmap or timeline for future features or milestones in the current file.
4. **Implicit Modularity**: The structure suggests a vision of a modular, extensible system for multi-agent terminal orchestration.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Define the "Why"**: Expand `idea.md` with a high-level vision statement explaining the core problem fork_agent solves for developers.
2. **Develop a Roadmap**: Add a dedicated "Roadmap" section with specific upcoming features (e.g., "Enhanced Windows support", "New Agent integrations like OpenAI").
3. **Future Capabilities**: Document planned expansions for the "Cookbook" system to handle more complex multi-step reasoning.
4. **Contribution Vision**: Define how the project intends to evolve as an open-source tool, acknowledging original inspirations (indydevdan).

## Conclusion
While the structural foundation is clear and well-aligned with the code, the document lacks the strategic foresight and roadmap necessary to guide future development.
