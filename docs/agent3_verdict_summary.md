The Zellij fix audit received a final verdict of PASS, successfully resolving all 4 critical bugs and implementing all 5 recommendations.
The implementation now correctly handles named sessions and detached execution, meeting all established requirements.
Remaining operational risks like error handling for command failures match existing project patterns and are not regressions.
